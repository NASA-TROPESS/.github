# Welcome to the NASA-TROPESS GitHub Organization

Tropospheric sounding from satellite observations provides critical information about atmospheric composition and its impact on human health and climate. The TRopospheric Ozone and Precursors from Earth System Sounding (TROPESS) project will generate Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) of ozone and other atmospheric constituents by processing data from multiple satellites through a common retrieval algorithm and ground data system. These products will be rigorously validated using uncertainty analysis in conjunction with independent measurements. These steps will quantify the accuracies needed to make long-term trends through multi-satellite records and chemical data assimilation. Scientific analysis and evaluation leading to peer-reviewed publications will demonstrate the scientific value of these ESDRs and their utility to the broader community. The repositories within this organization are related to TROPESS data processing and usage.
